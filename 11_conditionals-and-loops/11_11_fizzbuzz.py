# You start this journey with a number `n`.
# You have to display a string representation of all numbers from 1 to n,
# but there are some constraints:
# - If the number is divisible by 3, write `Fizz` instead of the number
# - If the number is divisible by 5, write `Buzz` instead of the number
# - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, write `FizzBuzz` instead of the number

    if num % 15 == 0:
        print("Fizzbuzz")
    elif num % 5 == 0:

    elif num % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    else:
