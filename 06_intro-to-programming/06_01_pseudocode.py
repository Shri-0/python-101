# Your cat just had kittens! Now you want to put up an ad to give them
# to your friends. You'll need to save all names of the kittens,
# confirm that they each of them is cute, and show a message that
# that kitten is ready for adoption.
#
# Break this task up into a couple of steps of pseudocode
# and write the pseudocode below in code comments.
# You don't need to write any funct

Kittens = ["Kitten1", "Kitten2", "Kitten3", "Kitten4"]    #Display and store each of the kitten names in an array

for kit in Kittens:										  #set up the cycle to loop through each kitten name
    print(kit + " is cute and is ready for adoption!")	  #display each kitten and confirm they are ready for adoption
